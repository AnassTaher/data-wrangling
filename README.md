# Main Question
What role do age and nationality play in influencing Olympic results?

# Sub-Questions

## 1. How does the age distribution among athletes impact medal-winning probabilities across diverse Olympic sports, and are there specific age groups that exhibit higher success rates?(winrate and flat amount of wins)

### 1.1. Check which sport is won the most by which age group


## 2. Question 1, but for nationiality: In what ways do the nationalities of athletes contribute to the overall medal count, considering variations in team dynamics, training philosophies, and cultural approaches to sports performance?

## 3. Do athletes who have previously won medals exhibit any unique characteristics or patterns in their subsequent performances, suggesting a "medal-winning mindset" or sustained excellence?

## 4. Can we identify any anomalies or surprises in the dataset where athletes with unconventional physical attributes or from less-represented nations outperform expectations in specific sports?


# Notes:
- The dataset only contains "Teams" and not "ethnicities" or "nationalities" of the athletes. This means that we can only analyze the country of the athelete's team and not the country of the athlete's origin.
