# Main Question
What role do age and nationality play in influencing Olympic results?

# Sub-Questions

## 1. How does the age distribution among athletes impact medal-winning probabilities across diverse Olympic sports, and are there specific age groups that exhibit higher success rates?(winrate and flat amount of wins)

### 1.1. Check which sport is won the most by which age group
### 1.2. What is the average age of the athletes who win medals in each sport?
### 1.3. What is the average age of the athletes in each region vs the average age of the athletes who win medals in each region?
### 1.4. How does the average age of top performance(minimum 1 gold medal) in each region compare to each other 


## 2. Question 1, but for nationiality: In what ways do the nationalities of athletes contribute to the overall medal count, considering variations in team dynamics, training philosophies, and cultural approaches to sports performance?

## 3. Do athletes who have previously won medals exhibit any unique characteristics or patterns in their subsequent performances, suggesting a "medal-winning mindset" or sustained excellence?

## 4. Can we identify any anomalies or surprises in the dataset where athletes with unconventional physical attributes or from less-represented nations outperform expectations in specific sports?

## 5. How has the average age of athletes changed over time, and what factors might have contributed to these trends?

## 6. What are the most successful sports for each region, and how do these trends change over time?


# Notes:
- The dataset only contains "Teams" and not "ethnicities" or "nationalities" of the athletes. This means that we can only analyze the region of the athelete's team and not the region of the athlete's origin.
